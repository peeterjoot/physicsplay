- cref to a lemma isn't working (reciprocityTheorem.tex)?  shows up as eq.

- figure out how to change listing header from figure to listing (seen an answer for this on tex.stackexchange).

- figure out where to put a biographical blurb (for this and other collections).
  bio.txt has what I put on the google books biography tab for gabook.pdf (and others).

- undef references:
