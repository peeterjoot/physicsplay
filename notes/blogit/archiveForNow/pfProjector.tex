On a question I am trying from an old exam prior to the upcoming final relates to hydrogen atom states.  An initial state is given:

\begin{equation*}
\ket{\psi(0)} = \inv{\sqrt{3}} \left( 
\ket{100} + \ket{210} + \ket{211}
\right)
\end{equation*}

and I calculated an evolved state at a specific time $t_0$ (specially picked so that the numbers work out nicely):

\begin{equation*}
\ket{\psi(t_0)} = \inv{\sqrt{3}} \left( 
e^{-i2\pi i/3} \ket{100} + 
e^{i\pi i/3} (
\ket{210} + \ket{211} )
\right).
\end{equation*}

The next part of the question says that an $L_z$ measurement is performed with outcome 0, and asks for the ket $\ket{\psi_{\text{after}}(t_0)}$ right after the measurement.

A zero measurement means that we have measured an $L_z$ eigenvalue of $m \Hbar = 0$, or $m = 0$, so we can only have states

\begin{equation*}
\ket{\psi_{\text{after}}(t_0)} = a \ket{100} + b \ket{210} 
\end{equation*}

Other than $\Abs{a}^2 + \Abs{b}^2 = 1$, can we say anything more about this post $L_z$ measurement state?
