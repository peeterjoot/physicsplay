My quantum text, leading up to the connection formulas for WKB and the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition states that for

\begin{equation*}
u'' + c x^n u = 0
\end{equation*}

one finds that one solution is

\begin{align*}
u &= A \sqrt{\eta k} J_{\pm m}(\eta) \\
m &= \inv{n + 2} \\
k^2 &= c x^n \\
\eta &= \int_0^x dx' k(x')
\end{align*}

I had like to know how this was arrived at.  What set of change of variables would one make to put the differential equation into the standard Bessel differential form.
