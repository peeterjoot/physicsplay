This document was produced while taking the Fall 2016, University of Toronto
Electromagnetic Theory
course (ECE1228H), taught by Prof.\ M. Mojahedi.


\paragraph{Course Syllabus}

This course covers the Fundamentals of electromagnetic theory, including (time permitting) topics such as

\begin{itemize}
\item Maxwell's equations
\item constitutive relations and boundary conditions
\item wave polarization.
\item Field representations: potentials
\item Green's functions and integral equations.
\item Theorems and concepts: duality, uniqueness, images, equivalence, reciprocity and Babinet's principles.
\item Plane cylindrical and spherical waves and waveguides.
\item radiation and scattering.
\end{itemize}

%The text for this course was \citep{pozar2009microwave}.  It was not a required text, and the course was taught off of slides.
