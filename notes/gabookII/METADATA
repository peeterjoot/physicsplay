The derivation itself is not too hard.  Reconciling all the different notations is actually the tricky bit.  Schwartz does this in terms of the dual field tensors F and G, Doran/Lasenby have their GA \$F \\gamma_k F\$ formulation, wikipedia had something different either of than those, and I'd seen in another paper that Jackson used something completely different.  At the time I did not have Jackson to see how he did it.

Very interesting here is that we end up with what looks like the Lorentz force law by only looking at conservation requirements based on Maxwell's equation itself.  Calling the Poynting vector a field momentum density by analogy (because it showed up in what appeared to be an Energy/momentum (density) four vector) is then seen to be very justifiable.  Previously I'd seen that it took two Lagrangians for electrodynamics.  One for the fields and one for the interaction term.  But now it looks like the interaction term follows from the fields (in a hand waving, fuzzy, not yet fully understood way).  Quite interesting, and worth more thought, but seeing how one gets the interaction term from the QM field equation should probably take precedence.

Calculating the rate of change of probability, and using Schrodinger's equation and its conjugate allows for the definition of a probability current, and an electromagnetic like probability-density/current-density conservation law.

What I thought was interesting was that if you put this into a four vector form as a spacetime divergence (ie: the Lorentz gauge of electrodynamics), the resulting 'four-component' current vector needs only a \$\\gamma^0 \\partial_0\$ term to be added to it, for that current itself to be the Dirac Lagrangian (omitting the local-gauge term eA).  So it looks like taking the spacetime divergence of the Dirac Lagrangian essentially gives you the probability/current conservation equation (except now this would also produce an extra timelike term not there in the original Schrodinger's equation.)  There are some notational differences with the wikipedia form of the Dirac Lagrangian, but I believe all the basic content is there once those differences are accounted for.  Very surprising to see the Dirac Lagrangian fall so naturally out of the Schrodinger (non-relativistic) equation.

I also observe that the probability wave function is perhaps naturally expressed as a relativistic four vector (with a \$\\gamma_0\$ term factored out).  I still don't understand how Maxwell's equation and QM fit together, but with Maxwell's equation or Lagrangian expressible strictly in terms of four vectors (or the four-gradient and four-curl of such four vectors), there would be a logical cleanliness if one could also express the (relativistic) QM laws strictly in terms of four vectors.  Definitely worth playing with.

I'd tried to do this a couple times using complex exponentials and never really gotten it right because of attempting to use the pseudoscalar as the imaginary for the phasors, instead of introducing a completely separate commuting imaginary.  The end result is an energy expression for the volume element that has the structure of a mechanical Hamiltonian.),

I may have attempted to blunder through this before, but believe this to be more clear than any previous attempts.  What's missing is relating this to polarization states of different types and relationships to Jones vectors and so forth.  Also, it's likely possible to express things in a way that doesn't require taking any real parts provided one uses the pseudoscalar instead of the scalar complex imaginary appropriately.)

   WHAT => qq(My own attempt to walk through the Lorentz transformation of the pair of Lorentz force and power equations, as done in Bohm's 'The Special Theory of Relativity'.  Bohm's text left out a number of details, as well as had a number of sign typos and some dropped terms.  Try to get it right.  Was able to do some of it, but part of the final "the reader can verify bits" have me stumped.  How to do those last bits is not obvious to me, which is likely why Bohm left this out of this pseudo-layman book.  This set of notes starts off with a large digression on how to express and translate from the GA hyperbolic exponential Lorentz boost formulation to the "classical" coordinate and vector representations used in the Bohm text and other places.  My initial reason for writing that up for myself all in one place was that I intended to try the Lorentz force boost procedure of the Bohm text completely in GA form, but I also have not gotten to attempting that.  My goal was to finish the details of the "old-fashioned" way first, but the algebra for that way is so messy I don't see how to do it. ),
