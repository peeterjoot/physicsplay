Peeter Joot is a computer programmer for IBM Canada, and works on the Unix/Windows version of DB2.  His years of database programming have been in the lowest levels of the guts of the DB2 product, doing system level programming like asynchronous IO implementation and exploitation, Linux and 64-bit porting, concurrency infrastructure (lockless reader/writer mutex implementation, ...), and some aspects of DB2's pureScale redundancy and failover support.
Peeter received a BASc in Engineering Science (computer) from UofT, and in recent times supplemented this with a number of undergrad physics courses.  He is currently enrolled part time as an M.Eng student in the UofT department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, studying electromagnetism.
