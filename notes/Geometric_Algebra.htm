<p>The Cambridge GA group has a number of <a href="http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/%7Eclifford/publications/">Geometric Algebra publications</a>, including the book <a href="http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/%7Ecjld1/pages/book.htm">Geometric Algebra for Physicists</a>.&nbsp; This book has an excellent introductory treatment of a number of basic GA concepts, a number of which are much easier to follow than similar content in Hestenes's "New Foundations for Classical Mechanics".&nbsp; When it comes to physics content in this book there are a lot of details left out, so it is not the best for learning the physics itself if you are new to the topic in question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of the content of their book is actually available online in their publications above, but it's hard to beat a paper version that you can mark up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some online learning content from the Cambridge group includes <a href="http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/%7Eclifford/introduction/index.html">Introduction to Geometric Algebra</a>.&nbsp; This is an html version of the <a href="http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/%7Eclifford/publications/ps/imag_numbs.pdf">Imaginary numbers are not real paper.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Also see the notes for their <a href="http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/%7Eclifford/ptIIIcourse/GeometricAlgebraLectures.zip">Physical Applications of Geometric Algebra</a>&nbsp;course, taught to what sounds like final year undergrad physics students.&nbsp; The first parts of this do not need much physics knowledge.</p>

<h3>Baylis</h3>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.uwindsor.ca/users/b/baylis/main.nsf">Wiliam Baylis GA page</a>.&nbsp; He uses a scalar plus vector multivector representation for relativity (APS, Algebra of Physical Space), and an associated conjugate length operation.&nbsp; You'll find an intro relativity, GA workbook, and some papers on GA applied to physics here.</dt>
</dl>
<p>Also based on his APS approach is the following wikibook:</p>

<dt><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Physics_in_the_Language_of_Geometric_Algebra._An_Approach_with_the_Algebra_of_Physical_Space">Physics in the Language of Geometric Algebra. An Approach with the Algebra of Physical Space - Wikibooks, collection of open-content textbooks</a> </dt>

<h3>
<dt>
<p>Hestenes</p>
</dt>
</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Hestenes main page for GA is: <a href="http://modelingnts.la.asu.edu/">Geometric Calculus R &amp; D Home Page</a>.&nbsp; This includes a number of primers and introductions to the subject such as <a href="http://modelingnts.la.asu.edu/pdf/PrimerGeometricAlgebra.pdf">Geometric Algebra Primer</a>.&nbsp; As described in the <a href="http://modelingnts.la.asu.edu/html/IntroPrimerGeometricAlgebra.html">Intoduction</a> page for this primer, this is a workbook, and reading shouldn't be passive.
</dt>
<dt>&nbsp;
</dt>
<dt>Also availble is his <a href="http://modelingnts.la.asu.edu/pdf/OerstedMedalLecture.pdf">Oersted Lecture</a>, which contains a good introduction.&nbsp;
</dt>
<dt>If you do not have his New Foundations of Classical mechanics, you can find some of the dot-product/wedge-product reduction formulas in the following <a href="http://modelingnts.la.asu.edu/pdf/UGA.pdf">non-metric treatment of GA</a>.</dt>
</dl>
<p>Also interesting is this <a href="http://modelingnts.la.asu.edu/pdf/GTG.w.GC.FP.pdf">Gauge Theory Gravity with Geometric Algebra</a>&nbsp;paper.&nbsp; This has an introduction to STA (Space Time Algebra) as used in the the Cambridge books.&nbsp; This also shows at a high level where one can go with a lot of these ideas (like the grad F = J formulation of Maxwell's equation, a multivector form that incorporates all of the traditional four vector Maxwells equations).&nbsp; Nice teaser document if you intend to use GA for physics study, but hard to read even the consumable bits because they are buried in among a lot of other higher level math and physics.</p>
<h3>Geometric Algebra for Computer Science Book</h3>
The book <a href="http://www.geometricalgebra.net/tour.html">Geometric Algebra For Computer Science</a>, by Dorst, Fontijne, and Mann has one of the best introductions to the subject that I have seen.
<dt>&nbsp;
</dt>
<dt>It contains particularily good introductions to the dot and wedge products and how they can be applied and what they can be used to model, then procedes after one gets comfortable with these ideas to introduce the subject axiomatically. The dot product (written with an asteric (*)) is temporarily defined using a determinant until the axiomatic treatment, which defers some of the mathematical learning overhead until one is ready for the ideas a bit better.
</dt>
<dt>&nbsp;
</dt>
<dt>Unfortunately, this book also introduces alternate notation for the generalized dot product (L and backwards L), which is distracting if one started with the Hestenes, Cambridge, or Baylis papers. This doesn't take too long to get the hang of though.
</dt>
<dt>&nbsp;
</dt>
<dt>There are other web resources available associated with this book that are quite good. The best of these is GAViewer, a graphical geometric calculator that was the product of some of the research that generated this book (see: <a href="http://staff.science.uva.nl/%7Efontijne/phd.html">Daniel Fontijne PhD thesis</a>, and the pdf <a href="http://staff.science.uva.nl/%7Efontijne/phd/fontijne_phd.pdf">fontijne_phd.pdf (application/pdf Object)</a>). Performing the GAViewer tutorial exercises is a great way to build some intuition to go along with the math (putting the geometric back in the algebra).
</dt>
<dt>&nbsp;
</dt>
<dt>There are specific GAViewer exercises that you can do independent of the book, and there is also an excellent interactive tutorial 2003 Game Developer Lecture available here:
</dt>
<dt><a href="http://www.science.uva.nl/ga/tutorials/">Interactive GA tutorial. UvA GA Website: Tutorials</a> (they have hijacked GAViewer here to use as presentation software, but you can go through things at your own pace, and do things such as rotating viewpoints). Quite neat, and worth doing just to play with the graphical cross product manipulation even if you decide not to learn GA.

<h3>Learning GA.</h3>
<dt>
</dt>
<p>
Of the various GA primers and workbooks above, here are a couple specific documents that are noteworthy, and some direct links to a few
things that can be found by browsing that were noteworthy.
</p>
<p>
   This is an 
<a href="http://www.science.uva.nl/ga/tutorials/">
   interactive GA tutorial/presentation for a game programmers conference
</a>
that provides a really good intro and has a lot of examples that I found helpful to get an intuitive feel for all the various product operations and object types.
</p>
<p>
Even if you weren't trying to learn GA, if you have done any traditonal vector algebra/calculus, IMO its worthwhile to download this just to just to see the animation of how the old cross product varies with changes to the vectors.
</p>
<p>
You have to download the GAViewer program (graphical vector calculator) to run the presentation. Once you do that you can use it for other calculation examples, such as those available in
<a href="http://www.geometricalgebra.net/downloads/gaviewerexercises.pdf"> these examples of how to use GAViewer as a standalone tool.</a>.
Note that the book the drills are from use a different notation for dot product (with a slightly different meaning and uses an oriented L symbol dependent on the grades of the blades.
</p>
<p>
A nice starting point is lect1.pdf from the 
<a href="http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~clifford/ptIIIcourse/GeometricAlgebraLectures.zip"> Cambridge PartIII physics course on GA applications</a>.  Only at the very end of this first pdf is any real physics content.
</p>
<p>
