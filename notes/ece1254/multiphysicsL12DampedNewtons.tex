\Cref{fig:lecture12:lecture12Fig3} illustrates a system that may have troublesome oscillation, depending on the initial guess selection.

Large steps can be dangerous, and can be avoided by modifying Newton's method as follows

The algorithm is
\makealgorithm{Damped Newton's method}{alg:multiphysicsL12DampedNewtons:402}{
\STATE Guess \( \Bx^0, k = 0 \).
\REPEAT
\STATE Compute \( F \) and \( J_F \) at \( \Bx^k \)
\STATE Solve linear system  \( J_F(\Bx^k) \Delta \Bx^k = - F(\Bx^k) \)
\STATE \( \Bx^{k+1} = \Bx^k + \alpha^k \Delta \Bx^k \)
\STATE \( k = k + 1 \)
\UNTIL{converged}
}

This is the standard Newton's method when \( \alpha^k = 1 \).
%ZWe want to pick \( \alpha^k \) so that Zwe minimize

\section{Continuation parameters}
\index{continuation parameter}

Newton's method converges given a close initial guess.  A sequence of problems can be generated where the previous problem generates a good initial guess for the next problem.

An example is a heat conducting bar, with a final heat distribution.  The numeric iteration can be started with \( T = 0 \).  The temperature can be gradually increased until the final desired heat distribution is increased.

To solve a general system of the form

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:multiphysicsL12:340}
F(\Bx) = 0.
\end{equation}

modify this problem by introducing a parameter

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:multiphysicsL12:360}
\tilde{F}(\Bx(\lambda), \lambda) = 0,
\end{equation}

where 

\begin{itemize}
\item \( \tilde{F}(\Bx(0), 0) = 0 \) is easy to solve
\item \( \tilde{F}(\Bx(1), 1) = 0 \) is equivalent to \( F(\Bx) = 0 \).
\item (more on slides)
\end{itemize}

The source load stepping algorithm is

\begin{itemize}
\item Solve \(\tilde{F}(\Bx(0), 0) = 0 \), with \( \Bx(\lambda_{\text{prev}} = \Bx(0) \)
\item (more on slides)
\end{itemize}

This can still have problems, for example, when the parameterization is multivalued as in \cref{fig:lecture12:lecture12Fig4}.

\imageFigure{../../figures/ece1254/lecture12Fig4}{Multivalued parameterization}{fig:lecture12:lecture12Fig4}{0.2}

It is possible to adjust \( \lambda \) so that the motion is along the parameterization curve.
