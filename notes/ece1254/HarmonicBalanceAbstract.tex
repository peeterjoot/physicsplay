With this work the Matlab based circuit solution system developed in ECE1254 for linear constant source RLC circuits is extended to compute steady state responses to periodic sources, to include support for a simple non-linear diode model, and to include support for Taylor expanded conductance circuit elements.
It is assumed that all input frequencies are multiples of a single fundamental frequency, and that only periodic outputs with harmonics that are multiples of the input frequencies will be observed.
The solution utilizes the \emph{Harmonic Balance} method described in \citep{giannini2004NonlinearMicrowaveCircuitDesign}, a method of solving for the Fourier coeffiecients of the system unknowns.
