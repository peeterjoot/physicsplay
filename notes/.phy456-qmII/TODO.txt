   - would be nice to restructure to have a more systematic layout.  Put the various worked problems and notes from the readings as problems at chapter ends for example.

   - started this.  problem set 1 moved into place (not all of it fits, perhaps move 1a to appendix)
   - thought I'd work through problem sets, adding descriptions and makeproblem/answer env,
      and move into place along with the lecture notes ... 

      However, I can only find ps1 written up?

      Perhaps all the problem
      sets were ungraded and I only did them on paper (I have all those qmII notebooks ... 
      maybe I kept them because I intended to review what I'd done).
  
   - have two mathematica references in "phy456/problems/variationalHelium.tex" ... convert to nbref

   - delete most of the initial attempt garbage in "./problems/variationHarmonicOscillator.tex" and just leave the part where it's done right (perhaps with a comment about why the niave attempt doesn't work).

   - started flattening the chapters, removing subsections.  Chapter and section is quite enough Bookmark hierarchy for these notes.

- indexing:
   (indexed the chapter and section headings)
   - visit all the subsection/paragraph/problem markers

-   can make part (.) reference a hyperlink with exersize env.

./phy456/problems/qmTwoPs4.tex:13:I was deceived by an incorrect result in Mathematica, which led me to believe that the second order energy perturbation was zero (whereas part (c) of the problem asked if it was greater or lesser than zero).  I started starting writing this up to show my reasoning, but our Professor quickly provided an example after class showing how this zero must be wrong, and I did not have to show him any of this.
