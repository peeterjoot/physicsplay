These are my personal lecture notes for the Fall 2011, University of Toronto Quantum mechanics II course (PHY456H1F), taught by Prof.\ John E Sipe.

The official description of this course was:

Quantum dynamics in Heisenberg and Schrodinger Pictures; WKB approximation; Variational Method; Time-Independent Perturbation Theory; Spin; Addition of Angular Momentum; Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory; Scattering.

This document contains a few things

\begin{itemize}
\item My lecture notes.

Typos, if any, are probably mine (Peeter), and no claim nor attempt of spelling or grammar correctness will be made.

\item Notes from reading of the text \citep{desai2009quantum}.  This may include observations, notes on what seem like errors, and some solved problems.

\item Different ways of tackling some of the assigned problems than the solution sets.

\item Some personal notes exploring details that were not clear to me from the lectures.

\item Some worked problems.

\end{itemize}
