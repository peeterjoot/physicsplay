<p>
About one years worth of notes for evening and weekend study of Clifford (geometric) algebra and associated physics.
</p>

<p> November 8, 2008
Wrote gasym.cpp, a C++ poor man's mathematica.
This is source code for a simple multivector symbolic calculator.
Also requires
Fontine's 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gasandbox/">ga sandbox</a>
package since I have used
these classes as a backend for the multivector parts.  The symbolic 
calculations were done the quick and dirty lazy way using a stl::map and
stl::list based
expression tree.
Geocities won't let me upload this file, but if you are interested in trying
(or extending this) for your own calculation, please let me know.
</p>
<p>
As coded this "calculator" is applied towards the 
expansion of a quaternion (or scalar plus bivector multivector in the GA lingo) representation of Euler angle exponentials to calculate the rotation matrix in terms of the half angles, and to also compute the rotation matrix in terms of 
Cayley-Klein parameters.

Some notes on Euler angles.
</a>
Compare the rotor form to the matrix form.  Tried the derivation in matrix
form too and found almost the same result.  Resolution of the mistake
and discussion ends up being somewhat interesting by itself.
</p>
<p>
Update: Nov 10.  After a digression to write some symbolic GA calculator software, the Cayley-Klein parameterization of the rotation matrix has been revisited.  Found the parameterization associated with problem 2.9 in GAFP.  Identifying the last differences from the book problem was done with a scripted search and replace to generate the 120 different matrixes that are possible with permutation of the parameters, and toggling of their signs (bivector terms also have a degree of freedom in the sign).  This was probably a silly exercise to take to absolute conclusion since the root idea ... that various half angle sine and cosine parameterizations can be used to generate that form of rotation matrix ... is what was important.  Very OCD of me to actually solve this beastie!

Application of Noether's to Lorentz transformed interaction Lagrangian
</a>
Boost and or rotation leaves the Lorentz force Lagrangian unchanged implying
a conserved quantity.  The conserved quantity is computed (a set of
wedge product results relating four vectors A, x, v).  This is also
expressed in purely vector form for a specific observer frame, 
producing a pair of vector equations, one of which supplies the
torque on the charged particle supplied by the field.
Finally the result is expressed in tensor and (four-vector) coordinate
form, which like the wedge product representation is also nicely symmetrical.

form, as well as a derivation of the transformational rules for the
transformation of a bivector expressed in tensor form.  This is

<a href="geometric-algebra/euler_lagrange.pdf">
Derive Euler Lagrange equations using Feynmans variational procedure.
</a>
Step one towards getting a feel for the multivector Lagrangian treatment: understand the scalar case.

Have considered the following in addition to the Euler-Lagrange derivation itself
<ul>
<li> Flush out a scalar derivation for the math behind Noether's theorem (need to work examples before I really understand what that's for).  Wanted to
derive it myself because of the multivector equivalent from GAFP.
<li>Hamiltonian from change of variables.  Utilized somewhat botched attempt
to derive the scalar (non-multivector) form of Noether's equation.
<li> Oct/20.  Revisited Noether's for the single variable case, and got it
straight this time.  Applications to follow.
<li>
Direct variation example on a purely kinetic Lagrangian in vector form without dropping down to coordinates.
<li>
Define a position and velocity configuration space gradient.  Once again the Lagrangian formulation provides a nice way of 
demonstrating why we need matched upper/upper or lower/lower indexes in the
basis vectors and partials of the gradient.  Here this is seen to be
dictated by the requirement to match the operational effects of the chain
rule in the linearization of a Lagrangian.
<li> Oct/21.  Work some examples.  In particular angular momentum conservation with radial potential, as well as Hamiltonian example for covariant Lorentz force.  Also drop in a multivariable Noether's derivation for completeness.

Take more care with the metric signature this time.  Also relates this to
the traditional observer dependent E + v x B form of the equations.  For the
first time the use of the wedge with the time basis vector as a means to 
select rest frame observer dependent quantities makes sense to me.  Perhaps
just because this had nothing to do with the Lorentz velocity addition
where I had trouble seeing how the wedge and the traditional means were
related.

<a href="geometric-algebra/stokes_revisited.pdf">
Revisit Stokes equation derivation in full generality.
</a>
Algebraically describe the boundary surface instead of pictorially.
The pictorial description of the surface and loop orientation obviously
doesn't 
work well for 
4D and greater volumes.
Having formulated this boundary description, this
leads naturally to a proof of the general case (the specific
cases of Stokes theorem for the vector and bivector cases were proved below.)
There are two bits of handwaving in the proof, but relatively minor ones.
Enough that my Engineering bias considers the proof complete enough
for practical purposes.

Updated to include all of the following
<ul>
<li> Formulate vector and trivector parts of Maxwell's equation in a form
that allows for application of generalized stokes law for bivectors.
<li> Apply this to directly obtain Gauss's laws for electrostatics and magnetostatics in integral form.
<li> Apply this to obtain Maxwell-Ampere's law (both integral and differential
forms).
Pictorial methods were employed to enumerate the
surfaces for the Gauss's derivations.  I found it neccessary to digress

Prove the clifford algebra formulation of some Stokes/Green's theorem equations.
</a>
<p>
Like so many things it seems I can't find treatments that I can understand
easily.
In particular I've found it hard to understand in an intuitive fashion
the generalized
Stokes law or Green's theorem treatment in both GA and differential forms texts.
</p>

<p>
So I've calculated this myself.
</p>

<p>
Covered in this set of notes is:
<ol>
<li>
The "fundamental theorem" for vector integration (integral of gradient of
a scalar field) is examined first.
<li>
An examination of bivector differential areas used to calculate and demonstrate
the validity of Jacobian determinants for change of variables.
<li>
Three special cases of the most general form of Stokes' law are treated.
The first is Green's theorem for integration around a loop in a plane.  Second is Stokes' law integration around the boundary of a general surface, and third
is the volume to surface area result.
<li>
Divergence relationships are shown to be duality variations of Stokes' law.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Everything treated here is done in a fashion that 
applies to any metric, as well as any number of dimensions.
</p>

<p>
Left untackled are the four-volume and even higher dimensional varients of Stokes' law.
This is probably enough of the general multivector integral transformation
equations that I can go back and comfortably tackle 
the integral equivalents of the electrodynamics field equations.
</p>
<p>
Also not done are specific examples of volumes and surfaces to get a feel
for this.  Try the hypersphere volume and area calculations from the Flanders
that were obvious to him but not me.  I also suspect that working some examples
of this will allow me to figure out how to represent the boundary surfaces
in the general case (suspect that this can be expressed as an alternating
form, much like the reciprocal basis calculation ... that intuitively makes
sense since we have normal elements constrained to the subspace spanned by the
volume).

<a href="geometric-algebra/lagrangian_field_density.pdf">Lagrangian field density used to derive Maxwells equation.
</a>
<p>
I couldn't find a derivation that used the electrodynamic field density to derive Maxwell's equations that I could understand, but puzzled it out myself, using
Feynmans ad-hoc method.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, which differs from other writeups that I have found, I had to
use both the E dot E - B dot B part (to generate the vector half of the equation),
and used the E dot B part to generate the trivector part of Maxwells equation.
</p>
<p>
The wikipedia article on the electrodynamic tensor has a rather unexplained
description of a Maxwells equation derivation with some sort of field varient
of the Euler Lagrange equations where they apparently do this derivation
using only the scalar part of the squared field.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of whether the E dot B term can be implied in some way, including
it results in a very neat result.  We can form a complex valued
Lagrangian density
from the curl of the vector potential, and use that directly to find the
STA formulation of Maxwells equation without having to reconstruct this
from the tensor results.  This may actually be something that I'm not just
rediscovering!

<p>
While examining metric issues below I also looked at how the tensor and bivector forms were related more closely.  I ended up with a fairly complete comparison of the tensor and bivector field equations, and have split my notes for that into a separate less meandering writeup.
</p>

<p>
Also calculated is the Lagrangian density in terms of potential directly from the spacetime curl of the potential.  There is no attempt here to try to recover the field equations from the density (followup separately).

<p>
John Denker has an <a href="http://www.av8n.com/physics/maxwell-ga.pdf">excellent STA exposition for the em bivector field.</a>  This however uses a different metric than Doran/Lasenby, so I went back and reexamined a number of the metric dependencies to avoid getting sign mixups translating between the two notations.

about the equations of motion resulting from a Lagrangian where the Kinetic

and one dimension, and I had a bit of fun generalizing this result.

I wrote this up specifying enough detail that all conventions and assumptions

Derivation of covariant Lorentz force law from proper time Lagrangian equations.
</a>
</p>
<p>
Take a guess at the covariant form of the Lagrangian equations for relativistic correctness.  Use this first derive the proper time force from the kinetic term, and followup with a derivation of the Lorentz force law (in covariant form) after looking at the result of applying this form of Lagrange equations to a velocity plus field dot product.  Although this doesn't start at the most fundamental point (ie: it assumes the form of the Lagrange equations instead of demonstrating that they actually solve the minimization problem), it is still
a very cool result, and what I expect may be a high point in my current understanding of pre-quantum level physics for quite a while.

<a href="geometric-algebra/gafp_lorentz.pdf">
Expanded notes on covarient Lorentz force law.
</a>
</p>
<p>
I now understand enough of the GAFP derivation (section 5.5.3, The Lorentz force law) that I can follow it.  However, I found that it still needed a lot of
margin notes to make it clear for myself.  Here
I try the derivation on my own.  Without the GAFP text, this is likely not
a good standalone explaination.
</p>
<p>
Once I got as far as understanding this covariant form, apply it to
expressing the Lorentz force in potential form.  Having seen the Lagrangian
for electrodynamics using the electrostatic potential field, and the vector
magnetic potential field, the obvious question is how one would express that
Lagrangian in a more symmetric four vector form.  I get as far as expressing
the proper Lorentz force as a spacetime gradient.  However, having done so I'm 
left having to go back to relativistic dynamics to see how one expresses
a work done integral in four vector form (where just summing over the
spatial force and spatial displacement is not likely enough).
</p>
<p>
Another followup bit was added, which is an explicit validation
that the spacetime curl produces the electric and magnetic field components
expected in terms of electrostatic and vector potentials.

This was a messy algebraic exercise, but shows the structure behind the
normal formulation of this.  Also show how the Lorentz guage is a natural
condition to impose in order for the electromagnetic field to be specified
as the gradient of the four potential, instead of having to express it as
the spacetime curl of this same potential.

<a href="geometric-algebra/velocity_tx.pdf">
Explicit expansion of Lorentz boost applied to rest frame event vector.
</a>
<p>
Dumbly plug through the algebra to see why GAFP can casually write their
four velocities as: v R = R gamma_0.

Use this result to show how the projective split that utilizes the wedge product and dot product ratios of proper velocities works.  That's yet another result from GAFP that I didn't understand reading their text.

Also transform both proper velocities to switch which worldline is observed
in its rest frame.  This demonstrates that the relative velocity is independant
of such a common transformation which matches intuition.  That said, 
intuition with
relativitistic issues is a hard to come by and I don't yet trust what I do have
of it.

What I did not demonstrate yet is whether this projective split is independent
of any boost.  I'll probably return to that later (and assume for now.)

<a href="geometric-algebra/cauchy_gradient.pdf">
Cauchy Riemann equations expressed as a gradient.
</a>
<p>
With some manipulation, it is shown that the pair of Cauchy-Riemann equations that describe the conditions that the function is analytic (has a derivative), may also be expressed as a single gradient equation.  Specifically, that the gradient of a complex function is zero in all analytic regions.  The gradient here is used in multivector form, where the complex imaginary is expressed as a plane 
unit spatial pseudoscalar (unit bivector).

We are used to seeing that real and imaginary
components of complex functions are harmonic (sum of second partials equal zero).  We see that this follows directly from the fact that the gradient (a vector square root of the scalar Laplace operator) is zero.
I thought this was a kind of neat result, and suspect that it can be related to
residue calculus in a plane.

Then the same calculation is done utilizing reciprocal frame pairs in order
to find the correct form for the gradient when expressed using an arbitrary
not neccessarily orthonormal basis (ie: get the upper and lower indexes all
in the right places).

<p>Having expressed the spacetime gradient with a (STA) Minkowski basis, and knowing that Maxwell’s equation written using the spacetime gradient is Lorentz invariant, we therefore expect that the square root of the wave equation (4-Laplacian) operator is also Lorentz invarient. Here this idea is explored, and we look at how the spacetime gradient behaves under Lorentz transformation.</p>

<a href="geometric-algebra/lorentz.pdf">A derivation of the Lorentz transformation from wave equation.</a>
</p>

<p>There are some subtleties to understand what it means for the speed of light to be constant.  I cannot say definitively that I still have an satisfactory or intuitive feel for such this constancy.  I think it is easier to to conceptualize the idea that light (ie: an electrodynamic field) is wavelike regardless of the motion of the observer.  Specifically, that light must satisfy the wave equation (ie: Maxwell’s equations) regardless of the space and time parameterization.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This little doc (which I am pleased with) presents a derivation of the Lorentz transformation using the wave equation.  This approach does requires a bit more math than the typical expanding light shell method, but is possibly more intuitive.  I’m curious if somebody else also new to the subject of relativity would agree?</p>

</p>

<p>The reciprocal frame vector concept is extremely powerful, and the way too dense and short treatment of this in the GAFP book isn’t sufficient to learn from in my opinion.  Here are my notes on this which are more thorough and dumb than the GAFP book.  Despite the treatment in that book being so short it has a rather fundamental place in much of the notation used later in the book (like all the index upper and lower notation).  Perhaps this isn’t well covered in their book because they assume familiarity by virtue of having seen this in the context of tensor algebra.  There appear to be enough people thoroughly confused by the tensor notation and covariant and contravarient nomenclature that I think this formulation in terms of simple vector operations well justified.  It also makes it easier to understand the more complex tensors.  An example is the electromagnetic field tensor which we later see to be a coordinate description of a bivector.</p>

</p>

<p>Looking at multivector exponential values in the context of the Laplace equation generated some bivector products that warranted understanding the general properties of how these multiply.  In particular vector vector products are well covered in the texts (GAFP, NFCM), but other higher order products are covered in much less detail.  Some of the questions that I had when writing up these notes led to the purchase of the book “Geometric Algebra for Computer Science” (GASC).  That book, which has by far the best introduction to the subject to be had, ended up covering much of the material I felt missing in the other texts.  Much of that missing detail I had worked myself by the time I had received that book, but it was still a very worthwhile read.  Later I found the 
<a href="http://staff.science.uva.nl/~fontijne/phd/fontijne_phd.pdf">
PhD thesis
</a>
by one of the authors which contains much of that text, and is just as readable as the book.   If you want a good intro to the subject before purchasing any texts, give that thesis a read.  I find a book much easier to read than a computer screen, but this particular book uses a different notation than all the others, which is distracting, so you can get an idea of some of the content before a purchase by looking at the thesis.  An additional great resource for learning GA is their interactive graphical GA calculator

Eventually I bought some books and if I had done so earlier, I wouldn’t have needed to figure out a lot of this on my own.   It was however time well spent as I learned things more thoroughly trying to figure it out from the basic properties.  I wanted to add details to the wiki pages that didn’t really fit with a wiki page, or were hard to do with wiki markup compared to latex, so eventually I stopped trying to make my notes in wiki and just typed them up directly here.  I never did go back and see if there was anything extra that I added to these that would be worth re-adding to the wiki pages.  What I have here is all based on my wiki page additions (and I was the only contributor at the time), and excludes the minimal bits that were there previously.</p>

<a href= "http://www.grassmannalgebra.info/grassmannalgebra/book/index.htm">the grassman algebra book</a>

also has a worked example of this which is nice.  I find the GA approach is easier to understand than the Grassman book approach.  The grassman book avoids the dot product to use the metric free regressive product approach.  I find the explicit use of the metric and associated dot product in GA more naturally when trying to bridge from traditional vector identities to a wedge product treatment.</p>

<a href= "cross/cross.pdf">The cross product in three and more dimensions</a>
</p>

<p>Revisiting my cross product treatment, but after discovering differential forms and the wedge product (Harley Flanders.  “Differential forms and Applications to the Physical Sciences”).  This was curtosy of Tor who was smart enough to search for it. </p>

<p>I had trouble with relating the wedge product on differential quantities to vectors.  I could see this was related to my old attempt to generalize the vector dot product.  I went back to my old notes and tried to lead from those ideas to the wedge product in a natural way.</p>

<p>This doc contains a few interesting bits. </p>

<p>A coordinate description of vector rejection (difference from projection) in terms of determinants is developed.  This provides a way to calculate the normal component of a vector with respect to a spanning set.</p>

<p>This is used to calculate the area and volume of an N dimensional hyper-parallelogram, or hyper-parallopiped.</p>

<p>Also included is a calculation of a general normal to a set of vectors based on Null space calculation.  Of particular interest is the description of the case when such a normal cannot necessarily be unambiguously defined.</p>

<p>The ideas here are then used to try to intuitively introduce the wedge product and a dot product on pairs of wedge products, without also introducing differentials.  The wedge product and the normal and rejection concepts are all related by the determinant (in fact the determinant really ought to be viewed as generated by the wedge product).</p>

<p>I end with an poor attempt to introduce differential forms for geometric area and volume elements.  When attempting to find a treatment of differnential forms that I could understand I ended up discovering Geometric Algebra.  That subject has exactly what I was looking for as the “answer” for all this generalized vector algebra.  Due to the time required to study that algebraic toolbox I have not yet gotten back to the differential forms that started me down that path.  Soon I hope.</p>

Derivation of the wave equation in free space and in presence of matter using the normal triple cross product vector relation identity method.  Followup with a four vector complex number treatment that puts the equations in a much more symmetrical form, that highlights the complex number factor that is naturally associated with the magnetic field. </p>

<p>I later followed up on this idea of complex representation in more detail in an email to Tor (at which point I got excited about it and wondered why this wasn’t in all the E&amp;M books since it was so simple and natural and appropriate seeming).  I should dig up and write that up since it would be a nice bridge to the GA ideas.</p>

<p>Circa ~1999
<a href= "cross-1-15/cross_1_15.pdf">Old cross product generalization musings.</a>
</p>

<p>The three dimensionality (and even non-2 dimensionality) of the cross product always bugged me.  I never saw any hint (or if I did I didn’t recognize it) about existing generalizations or degeneralizations of the cross product, even with four years of Engineering classes.  So, one day I felt like “mathing” as my wife and kids call now it, and played with generalizing it.</p>

<p>Starting point was looking at torque in a plane (aka: Feynman Lectures, Vol I), and considering the work done by an incremental rotation, then doing the same for three dimensions.  You end up with the cross product as an operator, and it takes the form of a completely antisymmetric matrix.  I now know that this naturally expresses the antisymmetry of the wedge product (ie: cross product as the dual of a bivector).</p>

<p>In these notes I attempted to take this cross product operator form and extract some of the structure.  In particular I factored this antisymmetric matrix into the product of diagonal and permutation product matrixes, and tried to use that as a way to define a generalized cross product.  I was able to create a 4D cross product generalization in matrix form that had at least some of the 3D cross product properties (and properties of the 2D de-generalization of the cross product).  However, the core problem here is that one doesn’t know how to define the normal that is intrinsic to the cross product, so the whole approach is kind of busted.</p>

<p>After starting with generalizing the cross product using incremental rotation as a starting point, I went back to the other starting point in the cross product definition, where the cross product is defined in terms of Euclidean normal vector properties (where one such orientation of the general normal between two vectors is picked).</p>

<p>There is a final attempt to generalize this further to 5D, but I don’t think I did a particularily good job at it.  The most notable issue is that the 4D version wasn’t really well defined, and worse, I invented a 4D cross product generalization that I didn’t know any applications for.</p>

<p>Perhaps even worse than inventing a cross product generalization for was that I spent a bunch of time working out stuff that others had already figured out much more completely than I, and I didn’t go looking to see what others had done first to ensure I wasn’t (badly) reinventing the wheel.  My friend 
<a href="http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~aamodt/">
Tor Aamodt
</a>
(Prof at UBC), says this is one of the biggest reasons that grad students have thesis advisors.  If I had stayed in school and done this in an academic context I would have had the good fortune to have somebody help point out that I was wasting time.</p>

<p>The final bits in this (long) set of notes was as far as I went with these ideas for quite a while and ended up dropping math as a hobby again for a number of years.</p>
