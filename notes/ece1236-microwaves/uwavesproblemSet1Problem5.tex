\makeproblem{Lossless transmission line.}{uwaves:problemSet1:5}{ 
\index{transmission line!lossless}

A lossless transmission line with characteristic impedance \( Z_0 = 50 \Omega \)
is to be matched to
a load consisting of a series combination of a resistor \( RL = 20 \Omega \) and a capacitor \( CL = 5.3 \si{pF} \)
. For this purpose an open stub of length \( h \) and the line of length \( d \) are used.
All lines are air filled and \( f = 1 \si{GHz} \).

FIXME: picture.

\makesubproblem{}{uwaves:problemSet1:5a}

Determine the normalized load impedance and plot it on the Smith Chart. Plot also the corresponding constant VSWR circle.

\makesubproblem{}{uwaves:problemSet1:5b}

Using the Smith Chart determine the line-length \( d \) that minimizes the open stublength \( h \) (in \si{cm}). What is the value of the normalized admittance \( Y_A \) in this case?

\makesubproblem{}{uwaves:problemSet1:5c}
Determine the corresponding minimum length of the open stub \( h \) (in \si{cm}).

\makesubproblem{}{uwaves:problemSet1:5d}

What would be the minimum length of the open stub \( h \) (in \si{cm}) if it were shorted
instead of left open (and the length \( d \) is kept the same)?
