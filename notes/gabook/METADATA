The derivation itself is not too hard.  Reconciling all the different notations is actually the tricky bit.  Schwartz does this in terms of the dual field tensors F and G, Doran/Lasenby have their GA \$F \\gamma_k F\$ formulation, wikipedia had something different either of than those, and I'd seen in another paper that Jackson used something completely different.  At the time I did not have Jackson to see how he did it.

Very interesting here is that we end up with what looks like the Lorentz force law by only looking at conservation requirements based on Maxwell's equation itself.  Calling the Poynting vector a field momentum density by analogy (because it showed up in what appeared to be an Energy/momentum (density) four vector) is then seen to be very justifiable.  Previously I'd seen that it took two Lagrangians for electrodynamics.  One for the fields and one for the interaction term.  But now it looks like the interaction term follows from the fields (in a hand waving, fuzzy, not yet fully understood way).  Quite interesting, and worth more thought, but seeing how one gets the interaction term from the QM field equation should probably take precedence.

Calculating the rate of change of probability, and using Schrodinger's equation and its conjugate allows for the definition of a probability current, and an electromagnetic like probability-density/current-density conservation law.

What I thought was interesting was that if you put this into a four vector form as a spacetime divergence (ie: the Lorentz gauge of electrodynamics), the resulting 'four-component' current vector needs only a \$\\gamma^0 \\partial_0\$ term to be added to it, for that current itself to be the Dirac Lagrangian (omitting the local-gauge term eA).  So it looks like taking the spacetime divergence of the Dirac Lagrangian essentially gives you the probability/current conservation equation (except now this would also produce an extra timelike term not there in the original Schrodinger's equation.)  There are some notational differences with the wikipedia form of the Dirac Lagrangian, but I believe all the basic content is there once those differences are accounted for.  Very surprising to see the Dirac Lagrangian fall so naturally out of the Schrodinger (non-relativistic) equation.

I also observe that the probability wave function is perhaps naturally expressed as a relativistic four vector (with a \$\\gamma_0\$ term factored out).  I still don't understand how Maxwell's equation and QM fit together, but with Maxwell's equation or Lagrangian expressible strictly in terms of four vectors (or the four-gradient and four-curl of such four vectors), there would be a logical cleanliness if one could also express the (relativistic) QM laws strictly in terms of four vectors.  Definitely worth playing with.
