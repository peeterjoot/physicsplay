\section{Introduction}

According to the handbook of van Leunen \cite{vanleunen},
this paragraph---and certainly this
section---should be longer than one sentence.

\section{More references}

Here we see if the reference \cite{Narendra_1990}
to the Narendra article comes out OK, in particular,
with volume, number \& pages.

The necessary information for those who would use BibTeX
is available in the 1988 document of Prof.\ Patashnik \cite{btxdoc}.
Interested readers who can read French may also
want to read Poussin's proof\cite{primes}, though
it has nothing at all to do with BibTeX.

\section{Conclusion}

This is the concluding paragraph.  Here I cite another of
Oren Patashnik's books\cite{btxhak} and, again,
van Leunen's and Poussin's \cite{vanleunen,primes}.
