\chapter{Typos in the course text}

There's a nice collection of errata notes for \citep{fowles1989introduction} in \href{http://www.6911norfolk.com/d0lbln/h7cf99/fowles.pdf}{http://www.6911norfolk.com/d0lbln/h7cf99/fowles.pdf}.

\begin{itemize}
\item page 137: equation (5.52)

A factor of \(k/L\) was dropped from the exponential.

\item It also seems to me that Fowles (3.45) has an additional factor of \(1/\sqrt{2 \pi}\) and that the \(1/\sqrt{2\pi}\) in (3.46) should have no
square root (both on page 81).

\item Go check the book for stuff I marked up... am sure there was more.  Add emailed Prof about at least one of these.

\end{itemize}
