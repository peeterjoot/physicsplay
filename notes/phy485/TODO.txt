   - go through Fowles for the typos notes added to the appendix.

   - indexing is very sparse (with some stuff that should be nested under other more general headings)

   - undid the use of \fixme package because it messed up the hyperlinks in the index.  Consider restoring for private draft mode.
      The output of the \fixme markup was weird too in this book form.

   - problems using \item[(a)] could use exersize env, then part (.) references could be hyperlinks.
