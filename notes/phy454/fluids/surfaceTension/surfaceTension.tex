\section{Traction vector at the interface}

Recall that our stress tensor has the form

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumL14:90}
T_{ij} = 
- p \delta_{ij} + \rho \nu \left( 
\PD{x_j}{u_i}
+\PD{x_i}{u_j}
\right)
\end{equation}

(here we are switching notations for the stress since we will be using $\sigma$ for surface tension in this section)

The traction vector components are

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumL14:110}
t_i = T_{ij} n_j =
- p n_i + \rho \nu \left( 
\PD{x_j}{u_i}
+\PD{x_i}{u_j}
\right) n_j
\end{equation}

Considering a control volume as illustrated in we can arrive at what we call the jump stress balance equation

\imageFigure{figures/continuumL14fig3}{Control volume for liquid air interface}{fig:continuumL14:continuumL14fig3}{0.2}

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumL14:130}
[\BT \ncap]^2_1 = \frac{2 \sigma}{R} \ncap - \spacegrad_I \sigma
\end{equation}

where

\begin{align}\label{eqn:continuumL14:150}
\sigma &= \text{surface tension} \\
R &= \text{radius of curvature} \\
\spacegrad_I &= \text{gradient along the interface}
\end{align}

and the suffix $2$ and prefix $1$ indicates that we are considering the interface between fluids labeled $1$ and $2$ (liquid and air respectively in the diagram).

For a derivation see Prof after class?

Force balance along the normal direction gives

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumL14:170}
\ncap [\BT \ncap]^2_1 = \ncap \cdot \frac{2 \sigma}{R} \ncap - \cancel{\ncap \cdot (\spacegrad_I \sigma)}
\end{equation}

If you do this calculation, you will get 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:continuumL14:190}
[-p]^2_1 = \frac{ 2 \sigma}{R}
\end{equation}

I think this was called the Laplace equation?

Question: How was $\sigma$ defined?  A: Energy per unit area.  

Figure (\ref{fig:continuumL14:continuumL14fig4}) was given as part of an explanation of surface tension and curvature, but I missed part of that discussion.  Perhaps this is elaborated on in the class notes?

Reading: An treatment of this topic that looks complete enough to understand looks like it can be found in \S 7 of \citep{landau1987course}.
