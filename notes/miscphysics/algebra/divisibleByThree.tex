\section{Motivation}

My daughter told me that any number that any number who's digits add up to a multiple of three are divisible by three.  I'd never heard of such a thing, and was surprised by it.  In the spirit of a true geek dad, I had to figure out why it works.

\section{Guts}

Let's represent our number by a sum of digits

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:divisibleByThree:10}
n 
= \sum_{k = 0}^N a_k 10^k,
\end{dmath}

and the condition for digits adding up to a multiple of three (say \(m\) times \(3\)) is

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:divisibleByThree:30}
\sum_{k = 0}^N a_k = 3 m.
\end{dmath}

We can pull that out of the sum, and sure enough, the remainder (in base 10) is divisible by three

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:divisibleByThree:50}
n
= 
\sum_{k = 0}^N a_k 
+
\sum_{k = 1}^N a_k (10^k - 1)
=
3m 
+
9 a_1 + 99 a_2 + 999 a_3 + \cdots
= 3 ( m + 3 a_1 + 33 a_2 + 333 a_3 + \cdots )
\end{dmath}

Aurora also mentioned that this works for \(9\) too, which we can see by inspection.  Pretty cool (just like my daughter).
