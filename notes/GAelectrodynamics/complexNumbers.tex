Show that complex numbers can be represented as even grade multivectors \( z = a + \Be_1 \Be_2 b \).
} % problem

\makeanswer{problem:gradeselection:ComplexNumbers}{
Let \( i = \Be_1 \Be_2 \), for which we find

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:gradeselectionProblems:260}
i^2
=
\lr{ \Be_1 \Be_2 }
\lr{ \Be_1 \Be_2 }
=
\Be_1 (\Be_2 \Be_1) \Be_2
=
\Be_1 (-\Be_1 \Be_2) \Be_2
=
-(\Be_1^2) (\Be_2^2)
=
-1.
\end{dmath}

The even grade multivector \( z = a + i b \) is thus seen to have all the properties required of complex numbers.
