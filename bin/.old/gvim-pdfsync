# gvim-pdfsync: Script for opening a file in Vim in OS X and positioning
#               the cursor at a particular line. If the file is already
#               open in an existing Vim, the cursor will be repositioned
#               re-opening the file.
#
#               The script is meant to extend the inverse searching
#               (c.f. PDFSync compatible PDF viewers (e.g., Skim or
#               TeXniscope) or DVI viewers that pay attention to 
#               source specials (e.g., TeXniscope)) to MacVim.
