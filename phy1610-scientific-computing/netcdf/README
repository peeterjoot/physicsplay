Here are some simple standalone netcdf samples for reading and writing a 2D array, with and without 
timestep values.

-- simplest.  using a 2D array and no unlimited (timestep) direction:
   readfile2DNoTimestep.cc
   writefile2DNoTimestep.cc

-- add a timestep direction using a 2D backing array:
   readfile2D.cc
   writefile2D.cc

-- avoid the 2D backing store and use a flat array for the matrix storage.  
   This requires a stride vector to describe the in-memory layout for the netcdf read and write operations
   (i.e. stridep, imapp)

   readfile.cc
   writefile.cc

-- this looks like pres_temp_4D_wr.cpp hacked up a bit.
   w2.cc

-- this looks like it's cut and pasted from the scinet slide: probably junk:
   r2.cc
