#The above parameters are interpreted by wave1d as (in this specific order):
# c        wave speed
# tau      damping time
# x1       left most x value
# x2       right most x value
# runtime  how long to simulate
# dx       time step to take
# outtime  how often to output a snapshot
# verbose  print output or not
